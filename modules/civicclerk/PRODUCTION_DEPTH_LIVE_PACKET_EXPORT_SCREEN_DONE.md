# Production Depth: Live Packet Export Screen

## Scope

Added the final live clerk-console action for the released API foundation: the `/staff?screen=packet` page can now create a records-ready packet export bundle through the live API.

## What Changed

- Added a packet export form to the Packet Assembly staff screen.
- The browser flow creates a demo meeting, creates the required packet snapshot through `/meetings/{id}/packet-snapshots`, then creates the export bundle through `/meetings/{id}/export-bundle`.
- The success state shows the bundle path, manifest path, checksum path, and next records step.
- Updated root runtime messaging, README, README.txt, user manual, landing page, changelog, browser-QA gate, tests, screenshots, and completion record.
- Added `exports/` to `.gitignore` because the local export workflow intentionally writes records bundles to disk.

## Next

All production-depth live clerk-console actions for the released API foundation now have browser form paths. The next work is consolidation: audit the whole staff workflow surface, remove any remaining stale "planned" copy, and then move on to the next CivicSuite module sprint.
