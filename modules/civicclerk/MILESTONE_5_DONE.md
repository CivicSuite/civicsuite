# Milestone 5 Done - Packet Assembly and Notice Compliance

Status: complete on branch `milestone-5-packet-notice-compliance`  
Base: `main` after Milestone 4 (`1a0e0b7`)  
Version: `0.1.0.dev0`

## Criteria Covered

- Packet snapshots are versioned per meeting.
- Packet snapshots preserve immutable agenda item ID tuples once created.
- Notice deadline checks compute the required deadline from meeting `scheduled_start` and configured minimum notice hours.
- Late notice checks return actionable warnings with a specific fix path.
- Special and emergency notices require statutory basis before public posting.
- Public notice posting requires named human approval through `approved_by`.
- Approved public notices create posting records only after compliance passes.
- Runtime `/` endpoint reflects the shipped packet/notice foundation and points to Milestone 6.
- Current-facing docs describe what shipped without claiming vote capture, minutes drafting, archive workflow, frontend UI, or AI workflow behavior.

## Verification Snapshot

- Targeted Milestone 5/root contract run: `10 passed`.
- Full suite after audit fix: `313 passed`.
- `python -m pytest --collect-only -q`: `313 tests collected`.
- `bash scripts/verify-docs.sh`: `VERIFY-DOCS: PASSED`.
- `python scripts/check-civiccore-placeholder-imports.py`: `PLACEHOLDER-IMPORT-CHECK: PASSED (11 source files scanned)`.
- `python -m ruff check .`: `All checks passed!`.
- Naive `scheduled_start` reproducer now returns `422` with `Use an ISO 8601 timestamp with Z or an explicit offset`.
