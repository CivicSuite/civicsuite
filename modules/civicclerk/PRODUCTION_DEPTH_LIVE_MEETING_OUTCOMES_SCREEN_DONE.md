# Production-Depth Live Meeting Outcomes Screen Done

## Scope

This slice adds the fourth live staff workflow screen for meeting outcome
capture while keeping CivicClerk at version `0.1.0`.

## What shipped

- `/staff` now includes a Meeting Outcomes tab for motions, votes, and action
  items.
- The browser form creates a demo meeting, captures an immutable motion,
  records a vote, and creates an action item tied to the source motion.
- Current-facing docs now distinguish shipped live outcome actions from the
  remaining planned staff-console actions for minutes, archive, connector
  imports, and packet export creation.

## Verification snapshot

- Staff UI contract tests updated for the fourth workflow screen.
- Root endpoint contract updated to point to the remaining live clerk-console
  actions after meeting outcomes.

## Not shipped

  export creation.
