# Production Depth Staff Workflow Screens Slice

Status: ready for audit
Branch: `production-depth/staff-workflow-screens`

## Shipped

- `/staff` upgraded from a static workflow map into first staff workflow screens for agenda intake, packet assembly, and notice checklist/posting-proof work.
- Screen tabs for Agenda Intake, Packet Assembly, and Notice Checklist with visible sample work queues, live API paths, safe next actions, and actionable fix copy.
- Root endpoint now reports that staff workflow screens are online and points the next slice toward live clerk-console form actions and meeting persistence.
- README, text README, user manual, text manual, changelog, and landing page now distinguish shipped staff workflow screens from still-planned live browser form submission.
- Browser QA evidence for desktop and mobile tab interactions, console output, overflow, and focus state.

## Not Shipped

- Live browser form submission from `/staff` into backing service APIs.
- End-to-end meeting workflow completion.
- React/nginx production shell.
- Release version bump or package release.
