## QA Notes

- Live API path checked through Vite proxy: `GET /api/meetings` returned two
  seeded meetings from the FastAPI process.
- Desktop viewport checked at 1440x1100.
- Mobile viewport checked at 390x1200.
- Loading, success, empty, error, and partial states were opened through direct
  QA URLs.
- Error copy tells IT to confirm the backend is running, verify staff auth mode,
  and retry.
- Keyboard/focus evidence: after tabbing through the dashboard, focus landed on
  the native search button with visible browser outline.
- Console evidence through Edge CDP: dashboard, meeting calendar, meeting
  detail with audit drawer, and forced error state all reported `console: clean`.
- Copy evidence through Edge CDP confirmed live API wording, meeting count,
  seeded meeting titles, and actionable error recovery text.
