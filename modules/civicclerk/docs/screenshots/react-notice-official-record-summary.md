Vite React app.

  Official Notice Record panel.
- `react-notice-official-record-mobile.png` - mobile success state.

- `../browser-qa/react-notice-official-record-qa-2026-05-01.json` - DOM,
  copy, accessibility, viewport, and console evidence.

Checks performed:

- Official Notice Record rendered deadline, statutory basis, human approval,
  posting proof, and immutable audit hash fields.
- Desktop and mobile renderings showed the proof-incomplete decision without
  horizontal overflow.
- Loading, empty, error, and partial states had actionable legal/IT fix paths.
- Console errors: 0.
