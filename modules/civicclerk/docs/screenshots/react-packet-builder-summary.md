- Live workflow: opened React Packet Builder against FastAPI on 127.0.0.1:8791 through Vite on 127.0.0.1:5191 after the packet-store failure isolation and nav-active fixes. The live page rendered finalized packet state without runtime errors.
- Desktop evidence: docs/screenshots/react-packet-builder-live-desktop.png
- Mobile evidence: docs/screenshots/react-packet-builder-live-mobile.png
- Rendered states checked: loading, success, empty, error, partial.
- State screenshots: docs/screenshots/react-packet-builder-state-loading.png, docs/screenshots/react-packet-builder-state-success.png, docs/screenshots/react-packet-builder-state-empty.png, docs/screenshots/react-packet-builder-state-error.png, docs/screenshots/react-packet-builder-state-partial.png
- Keyboard/focus: tab navigation reached D Dashboard with visible focus styling.
- Copy review: packet empty/error messages tell staff to promote agenda items, confirm the API/meeting, then retry.
- Contrast review: CivicSuite token palette preserved; status pills and form controls remained legible in desktop and mobile captures.
- Console: 0; exceptions: 0.
