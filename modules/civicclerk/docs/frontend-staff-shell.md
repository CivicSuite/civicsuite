# CivicClerk React Staff Shell

Status: Sprint 4 implementation slice with live agenda intake promotion,
packet builder draft/finalize workflow, legally explicit notice checklist work,
resident-oriented public posted-meeting portal, first meeting outcomes workspace, and
first minutes draft workspace. The dashboard now includes a clerk meeting
runbook that ties those workspaces into one end-to-end next-action path, plus
staff access status that makes OIDC browser-session readiness visible to clerks
and IT before sensitive meeting work begins.

The `frontend/` package is the start of the production React app that will
replace the HTML reference shell at `/staff`. It is adapted from the CivicSuite
mockup direction, but implemented as typed React/Vite code rather than as the
mockup's browser-global JSX bundle.

## What This Slice Includes

- CivicSuite staff shell with Brookfield branding, left navigation, surface
  switcher, search affordance, and partial-install disclosure.
- CivicClerk dashboard with priority work, meeting metrics, and clear clerk
  next actions.
- Staff access panel on the dashboard that reads `/staff/session`, shows local
  open mode, OIDC browser-session mode, bearer mode, or trusted-header mode,
  displays the signed-in subject/provider/roles when available, and gives clerks
  direct `/staff/login`, `/staff/logout`, and `/staff/auth-readiness` paths.
- Dashboard Meeting Runbook that derives each meeting's next safe action from
  scheduled meeting data, agenda promotion, packet finalization, notice legal
  proof, captured outcomes, citation-gated minutes, and public posting records.
  It shows ready/warning/blocked gates and routes clerks into the right
  workspace instead of making them stitch the lifecycle together manually.
- Meeting calendar for Sprint 1 navigation.
- Meeting detail workspace with the eight-stage lifecycle ribbon.
- Right-side audit/evidence drawer per meeting object.
- Live `/api/meetings` list loading for dashboard metrics, calendar cards, and
  detail selection, with a `?source=demo` fallback for deterministic QA states.
- Live `/api/meeting-bodies` management on the dashboard so clerks can create,
  rename, and deactivate boards or commissions before scheduling meetings.
- Live meeting scheduling on the dashboard, backed by `POST /api/meetings`.
- Live pre-lock meeting schedule editing on detail screens, backed by
  `PATCH /api/meetings/{id}` for title, body, type, start time, and location.
- Meeting body integrity checks so raw API callers receive actionable errors
  when schedule create/update references a nonexistent or inactive body.
- Schedule-edit audit behavior: backend edits are blocked once a meeting reaches
  the in-session lock point, with an actionable replacement-meeting fix path.
- First Sprint 2 Agenda Intake workflow: department submission, live queue,
  clerk ready/revision review actions, readiness metrics, and audit-hash cues
  backed by `/api/agenda-intake`.
- Ready agenda intake handoff into canonical agenda lifecycle work, backed by
  `POST /api/agenda-intake/{id}/promote`, with the generated agenda item id,
  `CLERK_ACCEPTED` status, promotion audit hash, and next packet-assembly step
  visible to staff.
- First Packet Builder workflow: staff can choose a meeting, select promoted
  agenda items, create a packet assembly draft through
  `POST /api/meetings/{id}/packet-assemblies`, review packet queue status, and
  finalize a draft through `POST /api/packet-assemblies/{id}/finalize`.
- Packet queues are loaded per selected meeting so staff do not accidentally
  finalize a packet from the wrong meeting context.
- First Notice Checklist workflow: staff can choose a meeting, see the computed
  statutory notice deadline, record notice type/minimum hours/posting time,
  enter the statutory basis and human approver, run the live
  `POST /api/meetings/{id}/notice-checklists` compliance check, and attach
  posting proof through `POST /api/notice-checklists/{id}/posting-proof` only
  after the checklist passes.
- Notice Checklist now includes an Official Notice Record summary that makes
  the clerk-facing legal decision explicit: proceed allowed, proceed blocked,
  or proof incomplete, with finalized-packet status, statutory deadline,
  posting time, statutory basis, human approval, posting proof, and immutable
  audit hash visible together.
- Notice Checklist legal-blocker states plainly explain when the statutory
  deadline has passed, why posting proof is disabled, and that the clerk must
  reschedule or document a lawful emergency/special basis before proceeding.
- Notice Checklist now renders a legal readiness proof chain covering packet
  finalization, statutory deadline, statutory basis, human approval, posting
  proof, and immutable audit hash so clerks can see which legal obligation is
  satisfied, missing, or blocked before proceeding.
- Notice Checklist is the MVP's most legally sensitive staff surface: it must
  show the deadline calculation, statutory basis requirement, human approval
  gate, posting-proof record, and immutable audit hash as proof that public
  notice obligations were met before a meeting proceeds. Empty and error states
  must name the legal problem and the clerk's next safe action instead of
  surfacing a generic API failure.
- Resident-oriented Public Posting portal: staff and residents can open a
  public-record view that reads `/api/public/meetings`,
  `/api/public/meetings/{id}`, and `/api/public/archive/search`, separates the
  posted agenda, packet, and approved minutes into official-record sections,
  provides missing-record clerk-contact guidance, and avoids implying
  restricted-session existence, counts, or summaries.
- Product routing: the nginx-served Docker/installer path maps `/staff` and
  `/staff/...` to the React staff dashboard, maps `/public` and `/public/...`
  to the React public portal, keeps workflow API traffic under `/api/...`, and
  preserves exact backend proxy routes for `/staff/auth-readiness` and
  `/staff/session`; the React shell selects the Public Posting workspace from
  `/public` and the staff dashboard from `/staff`.
- First Meeting Outcomes workflow: staff can choose a meeting, capture motions
  through `POST /api/meetings/{id}/motions`, load the meeting's captured
  motions, record roll-call votes through `POST /api/motions/{id}/votes`, and
  create follow-up action items through `POST /api/meetings/{id}/action-items`.
- Meeting Outcomes copy explains that motions and votes are immutable official
  records, that corrections must be append-only, and that action items cannot
  be created until they reference a captured motion from the selected meeting.
- First Minutes Draft workflow: staff can choose a meeting, load existing
  citation-gated drafts through `GET /api/meetings/{id}/minutes/drafts`, create
  a draft through `POST /api/meetings/{id}/minutes/drafts` with source
  material, sentence-level citations, model, prompt version, and human
  approver, and see `POST /api/minutes/{id}/post` block automatic public
  posting until a human adoption workflow approves the minutes.
- Minutes Draft copy makes clear that AI output is not the official record,
  every material sentence must cite a known source, and missing citation or
  provenance data is a clerk/IT fix path rather than a generic failure.
- Explicit QA state controls for success, loading, empty, error, and partial
  states.
- Actionable state copy that tells staff or IT what to do next.
- Staff sign-in error states now tell the clerk to sign in with municipal SSO
  and tell IT to inspect `/staff/auth-readiness` for missing OIDC browser-login
  settings instead of surfacing a generic session failure.

## What This Slice Does Not Yet Include

- Signed/enterprise installer release artifact. The unsigned Windows
  install/repair wrapper now starts the Docker-backed React staff app for local
  product rehearsal.

## Docker Demo Data

The Docker Compose profile sets `CIVICCLERK_DEMO_SEED=1` by default. When the
API process starts, it seeds Brookfield meeting bodies, three meetings across
the lifecycle, promoted agenda intake, a finalized packet, a legally explicit
posted notice checklist, captured outcomes, cited minutes, and a public archive
record. Set `CIVICCLERK_DEMO_SEED=0` for an empty local rehearsal database.

## Local Frontend Commands

Run these from `frontend/`:

```bash
npm ci
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
npm run dev
npm run test
npm run build
```

The Vite dev proxy sends `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:8776` by default so it
matches the documented Windows-first CivicClerk app command. Set
`CIVICCLERK_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://host:port` before `npm run dev` when the
FastAPI app is listening somewhere else.

Before any commit that touches this frontend, capture browser evidence for:

- success, loading, empty, error, and partial states
- desktop and mobile viewports
- keyboard navigation and visible focus
- browser console
- copy review for every user-visible warning, error, and empty state

For direct QA capture, the app accepts these query parameters:

- `?page=dashboard|meetings|meeting-detail|agenda|packet|notice|outcomes|minutes|public`
- `?state=success|loading|empty|error|partial`
- `?audit=1`
- `?source=demo` to bypass the live API and render fixed demo data
