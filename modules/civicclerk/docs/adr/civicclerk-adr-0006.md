# CivicClerk ADR-0006: Document and Search Extraction Order

Status: Accepted

## Context

CivicClerk needs packet documents, minutes source material, archive search, and
permission-aware public/staff access. CivicCore 1.2.0 ships search helpers and
shared ingestion/document-chunk primitives, while `civiccore.exports` and
`civiccore.provenance` cover cited source material and records-ready bundles.
CivicClerk v1.0.2 keeps meeting packet and archive document references
module-local until its own release train migrates those records to shared
document foreign keys.

## Decision

CivicClerk uses released CivicCore search helpers for permission-aware archive
search and uses module-local `document_ref` / source-reference fields wherever
canonical tables need to point at packet, minutes, transcript, notice, staff
report, or ordinance material. These references are intentionally opaque until
CivicCore document tables are fully extracted and released.

## Consequences

- `public_archive.py` imports `civiccore.search` instead of carrying a
  module-local search implementation.
- Canonical tables use `document_ref`, `source_references`, or source material
  JSON fields rather than foreign keys to unreleased CivicCore document tables.
- Extraction plan: when CivicCore releases document tables, add an ADR and
  migration that backfills `document_ref` values into shared document foreign
  keys while preserving compatibility tests for existing records.
