# CivicClerk MVP Plan

The first CivicClerk MVP is a vertical slice, not a full Granicus-style
replacement.

Current status after CivicClerk v0.1.19: all four MVP sprint goals below are
API-complete, tested, and represented by live-backed `/staff` cockpit panels.
The runtime foundation, staff workflow HTML reference shell, prompt gates,
release gates, connector import normalization, public archive filtering, the
React public portal, packet export bundles, backup/restore rehearsal,
OIDC staff-token validation, protected staff-auth rehearsal, deployment
preflight, and fresh-install rehearsal helpers are present. The OIDC
browser-session foundation is now shipped: `/staff/login` starts
authorization-code + PKCE sign-in, `/staff/oidc/callback` accepts the provider
callback, CivicClerk issues a signed HttpOnly staff session cookie for
protected staff APIs, `/staff/session` reports the active identity and roles,
and the React dashboard staff-access panel makes the current auth mode,
provider, subject, roles, and sign-in/readiness actions visible to clerks and
IT staff. The remaining production auth work is municipal IdP configuration,
operational hardening, and protected-deployment proof; it is not an unbuilt
OIDC browser-session feature. The first React app slice now exists under
`frontend/`: it translates the CivicSuite mockup into a typed staff shell,
meeting calendar, meeting detail lifecycle ribbon, audit/evidence drawer, and
explicit loading/success/empty/error/partial QA states, and the staff dashboard,
calendar, and detail flow now load live meeting records through `/api/meetings`.
Meeting body CRUD now has a backend API and first React staff dashboard
management surface. Sprint 1 meeting setup now includes live React scheduling
and pre-lock schedule editing backed by `POST /meetings` and
`PATCH /meetings/{id}`. Sprint 2 is now present in React through agenda intake
submit/review, ready-item promotion into canonical agenda lifecycle records
through `POST /agenda-intake/{id}/promote`, and the first Packet Builder
workspace for creating and finalizing packet assembly records from promoted
agenda items. Sprint 3 is now present with a legally explicit Notice Checklist
workspace for statutory deadline review, basis/approval capture, an Official
Notice Record proof summary, posting-proof attachment, legal-blocker copy, and
immutable audit-hash visibility, plus a resident-oriented Public Posting portal for public meeting list/detail/search
over posted agenda, packet, and approved minutes records with restricted-record
non-disclosure guidance. Sprint 4 is now
present with a React Meeting Outcomes workspace for immutable motion capture,
roll-call vote capture, source-linked action items, and append-only correction
guidance plus a React Minutes Draft workspace for citation-gated draft creation,
prompt provenance, human approver capture, and blocked auto-posting visibility.
The first Docker Compose deployment stack is now present with PostgreSQL 17 +
pgvector, Redis 7.2, Ollama, FastAPI, Celery worker/beat, and nginx-served
React. Compose now seeds a Brookfield demo dataset by default so staff can open
the React app against live API-backed data immediately. Unsigned Windows
installer source packaging is now present for the same Docker stack, including
install/repair and daily-start launchers, with explicit SmartScreen/Unknown
Publisher guidance for the supported unsigned public installer path. Remaining MVP work now centers on
municipal IdP deployment proof, real vendor API deployment proof,
city-approved retention/off-host backup proof, and deployment hardening. Signed
installer publication is not planned for CivicSuite's public free open-source
release path. The Docker/PostgreSQL backup and restore
rehearsal for the Compose product path is now present; real deployments still
need an approved retention schedule and off-host storage target. The connector
path now has a local import-sync runner that produces normalized ledgers from
exported agenda-system JSON, plus an optional Docker/Celery Beat schedule for
approved local export-drop ingestion. The first vendor live-sync operational
foundation is also present: proposed source URLs are validated through
CivicCore guards, credentials in URLs are rejected, source/run/failure state
persists in the vendor sync ledger, source health is computed as `healthy`,
`degraded`, or `circuit_open`, and the circuit opens after five consecutive
full-run failures or two post-unpause grace-period failures. The React staff
workspace now surfaces this ledger through a Vendor Sync screen with source
registration, health/circuit status, run-outcome logging, no-network safety
copy, persisted cursor visibility, full-reconciliation cursor reset, and
actionable IT fix guidance. The first guarded vendor-network pull
runner is present for one explicitly enabled source at a time: it refuses
circuit-open sources, revalidates the source URL, reads credentials from a
deployment secret env var, normalizes returned JSON through the existing
connector contract, and records the run outcome in the same circuit-breaker
ledger. The first scheduled vendor-network pull task is also present in Celery
Beat, disabled by default, guarded by both a schedule gate and live-network
gate, and limited to configured approved source IDs with per-source reports.
Remaining live-sync work is deployment proof against real municipal vendor APIs
and operational runbook hardening. The delta-planning, cursor persistence, and
operator reset contract is now present: each
supported connector gets an explicit "changed since" query parameter, sources
persist `last_success_cursor_at`, one-time and scheduled pulls plan from that
cursor, the cursor advances only after a fully successful normalized run, and
IT can clear or move the cursor without a vendor call when a full reconciliation
or replay from an earlier point is required, and each reset reason is preserved
as a `cursor_reset` run-log event.
The reusable City of Brookfield mock-city environment suite is now being added
as shared product infrastructure for the remaining CivicSuite modules:
`scripts/run_mock_city_environment_suite.py` verifies Legistar, Granicus,
PrimeGov, and NovusAGENDA connector contracts without vendor network calls,
labels public-reference versus vendor-gated interfaces honestly, and gives
future modules a repeatable baseline before module-specific assertions are
added. The same suite now validates a Brookfield Entra ID-style municipal OIDC
contract with issuer, audience, authorization-code + PKCE URLs, JWKS shape,
role claims, and staff-token validation without contacting an identity provider
or printing mock secrets, and it now validates a Brookfield
backup-retention/off-host policy contract with seven-year retention, monthly
restore-test cadence, encrypted immutable mock off-host storage, legal-hold
support, and restore-manifest fields without contacting storage providers or
printing secrets. Unsigned Windows install remains expected and supported;
installer and docs warnings now name the "Unknown Publisher" / "Windows
protected your PC" first-install experience directly and tell users it is OK to
choose "More info" and "Run anyway" only for official CivicSuite artifacts or
verified local builds. The pilot-readiness
rollup now separates developer-owned readiness from external proofs for code
signing, municipal IdP deployment, real vendor API access, and city
backup-retention/off-host storage approval.
