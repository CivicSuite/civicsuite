# CivicClerk Milestone 0 Reconciliation

## Section 20 ADR Triage

Queued for v0.1.0 scope because each question affects schema, user-facing behavior, source control layout, runtime dependency ordering, or release gates before CivicClerk v0.1.0:

- CivicClerk v0.1.0 canonical table list / any reduction from the 14-table canonical set.
- Public comments in v0.1.0.
- Transcription packaging in v0.1.0 vs v0.2.0.
- Shared resident portal shell boundary.
- CivicCore auth/RBAC extraction order.
- CivicCore document/search extraction order.
- Prompt-library repository strategy.
- State statutory-rule data-release strategy.

Excluded from v0.1.0 ADR queue:

- CivicCode-before-CivicZone ordering. This affects later module sequencing, not CivicClerk v0.1.0 implementation.
