# Milestone 4 Done - Meeting Lifecycle Enforcement

Status: complete on branch `milestone-4/meeting-lifecycle-enforcement`  
Base: `main` after Milestone 3 (`cf7452d`)  
Version: `0.1.0.dev0`

## Criteria Covered

- Meeting lifecycle state machine from `SCHEDULED` through `ARCHIVED`.
- Full `(from, to)` transition matrix coverage for canonical meeting states.
- Emergency and special meetings require a statutory basis before notice is posted.
- Closed and executive sessions require a statutory basis before moving in progress.
- Cancelled meetings can be cancelled from scheduled or noticed states and become terminal.
- Allowed and rejected meeting transitions write audit entries.
- Runtime `/` endpoint reflects the shipped meeting lifecycle foundation and points to Milestone 5.
- Current-facing docs describe what shipped without claiming packet assembly, notice compliance, votes, minutes, archives, frontend UI, or AI workflow behavior.

## Commit Trail

- `e3b3d74` - failing Milestone 4 meeting lifecycle contract.
- `c04466e` - meeting lifecycle runtime implementation and current-facing docs.
- `908588b` - milestone done file, TDD log update, browser QA screenshots, and mobile landing-page clipping fix.
- `d20b9a0` - normalized `meeting_type` before statutory-basis checks and added mixed-case bypass regressions.

## Verification Snapshot

- Targeted Milestone 4/root contract run: `153 passed`.
- Full suite after audit fix: `303 passed`.
- `bash scripts/verify-docs.sh`: `VERIFY-DOCS: PASSED`.
- `python scripts/check-civiccore-placeholder-imports.py`: `PLACEHOLDER-IMPORT-CHECK: PASSED (10 source files scanned)`.
- `python -m ruff check .`: `All checks passed!`.
- Auditor reproducer values now reject as required:
  - `Emergency SCHEDULED -> NOTICED`: `False 422`
  - `SPECIAL SCHEDULED -> NOTICED`: `False 422`
  - `Closed_Session PACKET_POSTED -> IN_PROGRESS`: `False 422`
  - `Executive PACKET_POSTED -> IN_PROGRESS`: `False 422`
- Desktop landing-page screenshot captured at `docs/screenshots/milestone4-desktop.png`.
- Mobile landing-page screenshot captured at `docs/screenshots/milestone4-mobile.png`; the mobile clipping found during QA was fixed before this milestone was marked complete.

## Explicit Non-Scope

- No packet assembly or statutory notice compliance workflow.
- No vote capture.
- No minutes drafting.
- No public archive workflow.
- No frontend application.
- No AI workflow.
- No release/version bump.

## Next Milestone

Milestone 5: packet assembly and notice compliance.
