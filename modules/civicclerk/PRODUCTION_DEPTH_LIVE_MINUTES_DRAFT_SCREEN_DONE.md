# Production Depth: Live Minutes Draft Screen Done

Status: complete  
Branch: `production-depth/live-minutes-draft-screen`  
Scope: browser-visible staff workflow action for citation-gated minutes draft creation

## What Changed

- Added a `Minutes Draft` staff workflow card to `/staff`.
- Added a live browser form that creates a demo meeting and submits a cited draft through `/meetings/{id}/minutes/drafts`.
- Preserved the CivicClerk minutes guardrail: drafts are created as unadopted and unposted records that require human review before any public posting workflow.
- Updated root runtime messaging, README, README.txt, user manual, landing page, changelog, browser-QA gate, and staff UI tests to reflect the shipped screen.

## UX Evidence
