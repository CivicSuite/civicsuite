CivicCore
=========

Shared platform library for the CivicSuite open-source municipal operations
suite. https://github.com/CivicSuite/civicsuite

What this is
------------

CivicCore is the Python library every CivicSuite module depends on for shared
platform plumbing. It is not an end-user municipal app.

What ships in the current development line:

  - civiccore.migrations - migration runner with idempotent guards plus the
    civiccore_0001_baseline_v1 shared-schema baseline and civiccore_0002_llm.
  - civiccore.db - shared SQLAlchemy declarative Base.
  - civiccore.llm - providers, prompt templates, model registry, context
    utilities, and structured output.
  - civiccore.audit - hash-chained audit primitives plus persisted audit-log
    hash and verification helpers.
  - civiccore.provenance - source/provenance metadata contracts.
  - civiccore.connectors - offline import/export manifest schemas,
    local-first import helpers for supported agenda-platform payloads,
    vendor delta request planning, storage-neutral live-sync
    retry/circuit-breaker primitives, and source-list status projections.
  - civiccore.testing - no-network mock-city proof contracts for supported
    agenda vendors, municipal OIDC, and backup-retention/off-host readiness.
  - civiccore.security - connector host validation, startup config
    validation, and encrypted JSON envelope helpers for secret-bearing config.
  - civiccore.exports - static export-bundle manifest and checksum helpers.
  - civiccore.city_profile - local city/deployment configuration models.
  - civiccore.auth - bearer-token role helpers for protected or mixed
    public/staff FastAPI routes.
  - civiccore.verification - content-bound browser release-evidence helpers.
  - civiccore.search - deterministic text normalization, matching, and
    reciprocal-rank-fusion helpers.
  - civiccore.notifications - notice deadline planning and publication
    compliance helpers with actionable warning codes.
  - civiccore.scheduling - cron validation and next-run helpers for module
    background jobs.
  - civiccore.ingest - shared discovery/fetch contracts, cited-source
    validation helpers, and the document-ingestion pipeline for PDF, DOCX,
    XLSX, CSV, EML, HTML, and text files with sentence-aware chunking, local
    Ollama embeddings, and pgvector-backed documents/document_chunks storage.

Still planned extraction targets:

  civiccore.catalog, civiccore.exemptions, civiccore.scaffold.
  civiccore.onboarding now ships storage-neutral profile interview
  helpers, but not a web onboarding UI or persistence router.

Credential storage, vendor-specific network adapters, vendor write-back,
worker scheduler runtimes, notification delivery queues, and legal
determinations are still not shipped platform behaviors.

Status
------

v1.2.0 is the current CivicCore downstream productization line. It carries the
shared document-ingestion pipeline used by the city-core release train, the
CO-7 freeze-line trust anchor, the CO-8 procurement evidence pack, and the
CO-9 closeout trail.
v0.22.1 remains the first attested baseline release. The
current line includes shared connector source-list status projection helpers, cron schedule validation helpers, startup config validation helpers, vendor delta planning,
reusable mock-city proof contracts, live connector sync retry/circuit-breaker
primitives, and persisted audit-log hash and verification helpers on top of
shared connector security/config helpers, onboarding profile helpers, auth helpers,
verification helpers, shared search helpers, local-first connector import
helpers, and notice deadline/compliance helpers on top of the audit,
provenance, manifest, export-bundle, city-profile, migration, and LLM
primitives. v0.2.0 shipped the
civiccore.llm module. v0.1.0 shipped the migration baseline.

Install
-------

From the current published GitHub release wheel:

    pip install https://github.com/CivicSuite/civiccore/releases/download/v1.2.0/civiccore-1.2.0-py3-none-any.whl

CivicCore is distributed as versioned GitHub release artifacts (not on PyPI).
Each release publishes SHA256SUMS.txt alongside the wheel and sdist. Verify
checksums before promoting an artifact downstream. v1.2.0 is the current
published downstream productization line and includes the shared
document-ingestion pipeline used by the city-core release train. v0.22.0 and
earlier releases are retained for historical installs only.

For development from a clone:

    git clone https://github.com/CivicSuite/civiccore.git
    cd civiccore
    pip install -e .[dev]

Compatibility
-------------

Current v0.1.0 module foundations still pin older civiccore lines.
Production-depth consumers should move only to the released CivicCore version
recorded in their compatibility matrix.
