"""LLM provider abstraction (Phase 2 extraction).

This module defines :class:`LLMProvider`, the abstract base class that every
concrete LLM backend in CivicSuite must implement. The surface here is
deliberately narrow and was extracted in Phase 2 of the civiccore split from
the records-ai status quo:

* :meth:`LLMProvider.generate` mirrors the call shape used by
  ``app/llm/client.py`` in records-ai (system prompt + user content, with
  optional retrieval ``chunks``, ``exemption_rules``, and ``images`` for
  vision-capable providers).
* :meth:`LLMProvider.embed` and :meth:`LLMProvider.embed_batch` mirror the
  single- and batch-embedding paths in ``app/ingestion/embedder.py``.
* :attr:`LLMProvider.name` and :attr:`LLMProvider.supports_images` expose the
  metadata the registry and routing code need without forcing callers to
  ``isinstance``-check concrete classes.

There is intentionally **no** ``chat()`` method on this ABC. Per ADR-0004 §6,
multi-turn chat is deferred until v0.3.0 — there is no concrete consumer of
multi-turn semantics in the current codebase, and locking in a chat surface
before a real call site exists would over-fit the abstraction. Adding
``chat()`` later is a backward-compatible change; getting it wrong now is not.

All methods are declared ``async`` because every existing concrete provider
(Anthropic, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible) is I/O-bound on an HTTP call.
