# CivicCore User Manual

Version: v1.2.0 (current downstream productization line)
Repository: https://github.com/CivicSuite/civiccore
License: Apache 2.0

This manual has three audiences:

1. **Non-technical evaluators** - what CivicCore is and why it matters.
2. **IT and module developers** - how to install it and consume the public API.
3. **Architecture reviewers** - what ships today, what is planned, and how the library fits into the CivicSuite stack.

---

## 1. Non-Technical Overview

### What CivicCore Is

CivicCore is the shared platform library underneath CivicSuite. It is the common
Python package that CivicSuite modules use for migrations, LLM plumbing,
provenance metadata, audit-chain primitives, export manifests, and local city
configuration.

It is **not** an app a clerk or resident logs into. End users interact with
module applications such as CivicRecords AI or CivicClerk. CivicCore is the
shared foundation those applications import.

### What the current development line ships

- `civiccore.migrations` - migration runner, idempotent guards, and the shared
  schema baseline.
- `civiccore.db` - shared SQLAlchemy declarative `Base`.
- `civiccore.llm` - provider registry, prompt templates, model registry,
  context utilities, and structured-output helpers.
- `civiccore.audit` - hash-chained audit primitives for tamper-evident local
  event streams plus legacy-compatible persisted audit-log verification
  helpers.
- `civiccore.provenance` - source, citation, document, and provenance metadata
  contracts.
- `civiccore.connectors` - offline import/export manifest schemas,
  local-first import helpers for supported agenda-platform payloads, and
  storage-neutral live-sync retry/circuit-breaker primitives plus vendor
  delta request planning and source-list status projection.
- `civiccore.testing` - no-network mock-city proof contracts for supported
  agenda vendors, municipal OIDC, and backup-retention/off-host readiness.
- `civiccore.exports` - static export-bundle manifest and checksum helpers.
- `civiccore.city_profile` - local city/deployment configuration models.
- `civiccore.auth` - bearer-token role helpers, staff-key route gates, and
  trusted-header config/source-boundary helpers for protected or mixed
  public/staff FastAPI routes.
- `civiccore.verification` - content-bound browser release-evidence helpers.
- `civiccore.search` - deterministic text normalization, matching, and
  reciprocal-rank-fusion helpers.
- `civiccore.notifications` - notice deadline planning and publication
  compliance helpers with actionable warning codes.
- `civiccore.onboarding` - storage-neutral onboarding profile field order,
  answer parsing, completion-state, and next-question helpers.
- `civiccore.scheduling` - storage-neutral cron validation and next-run
  helpers for module background jobs.
- `civiccore.ingest` - shared discovery/fetch contracts, cited-source
  validation helpers, and document ingestion for PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, EML,
  HTML, and text files with sentence-aware chunking, local Ollama embeddings,
  and pgvector-backed `documents` / `document_chunks` storage.

### What the current development line does not ship yet

The following namespaces remain planned extraction targets:
`civiccore.catalog`, `civiccore.exemptions`, and `civiccore.scaffold`.

`civiccore.onboarding` now ships shared profile interview helpers, but
full web onboarding flows and persistence orchestration are still not
shipped platform behavior.

Credential storage, vendor-specific network adapters, vendor write-back,
worker scheduler runtimes, notification delivery queues, and legal
determinations are also not shipped platform behaviors. Downstream modules must
not promote those behaviors as shipped CivicCore capability.

### Why Municipal Teams Should Care

- **Sovereignty:** Local-first defaults keep cities in control of their data and
  infrastructure.
- **Reuse without coupling:** Each CivicSuite module depends on the same
  versioned primitives rather than copying logic.
- **Auditability:** Shared contracts for provenance, export bundles, and audit
  chains make compliance evidence more consistent across modules.

## 2. Technical Guide for IT and Module Developers

### Install from a Release Wheel

CivicCore is distributed as GitHub release artifacts, not PyPI packages:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/CivicSuite/civiccore/releases/download/v1.2.0/civiccore-1.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Each release publishes `SHA256SUMS.txt` next to the wheel and source
distribution. Verify checksums before promoting a release artifact:

```bash
curl -L -o SHA256SUMS.txt \
  https://github.com/CivicSuite/civiccore/releases/download/v1.2.0/SHA256SUMS.txt
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

`v1.2.0` is the current published downstream productization line and includes
the shared document-ingestion pipeline used by the city-core release train.
`v0.22.1` is the first
CivicCore release with a Sigstore-signed
`release-attestation.json` and bundle. Earlier CivicCore releases are retained
for historical installs only and must not be treated as provenance baselines
unless a future additive attestation is explicitly authorized, published, and
recorded in `docs/ops/civiccore-tier1-retrofit-ledger.md`.

For local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CivicSuite/civiccore.git
cd civiccore
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Use LLM Providers

```python
from civiccore.llm import get_provider

provider = get_provider("ollama", base_url="http://localhost:11434")
text = await provider.generate(
    system_prompt="You summarize municipal records.",
    user_content="Summarize this request: ...",
)
```

Ollama uses the base dependency set. OpenAI and Anthropic require their SDKs
only if those providers are instantiated:

```bash
pip install openai
pip install anthropic
```

### Use Prompt Templates

```python
from civiccore.llm import render_template, resolve_template

template = await resolve_template(
    session,
    template_name="extract_request_fields",
    consumer_app="records-ai",
)
rendered = render_template(template, {"document_text": document_text})
```

The resolver checks app DB overrides first, code-level overrides second, and
CivicCore defaults third. Missing variables produce actionable render errors.

### Use Audit, Provenance, Manifest, Export, and City Profile Primitives

```python
from civiccore import (
    AuditActor,
    AuditHashChain,
    AuditSubject,
    CityProfile,
    ExportBundle,
    ImportManifest,
    PersistedAuditLogEntry,
    SourceReference,
    compute_persisted_audit_hash,
    validate_bundle,
    validate_manifest,
    verify_persisted_audit_chain,
)

chain = AuditHashChain()
chain.record_event(
    actor=AuditActor(actor_id="clerk-1", actor_type="staff"),
    action="packet_exported",
    subject=AuditSubject(subject_id="meeting-42", subject_type="meeting"),
    source_module="civicclerk",
)
assert chain.verify()

entry_hash = compute_persisted_audit_hash(
    previous_hash="0" * 64,
    timestamp="2026-05-01T12:00:00+00:00",
    actor_id="records-admin",
    action="request_created",
    details={"request_id": "RR-1001"},
)
assert verify_persisted_audit_chain([
    PersistedAuditLogEntry(
        previous_hash="0" * 64,
        entry_hash=entry_hash,
        timestamp="2026-05-01T12:00:00+00:00",
        actor_id="records-admin",
        action="request_created",
        details={"request_id": "RR-1001"},
    )
])[0]
```

These primitives are storage-neutral. They give downstream modules a consistent
contract without dictating where records are stored.

### Use Live Connector Sync Primitives

Use `civiccore.connectors` for the shared retry and circuit-breaker state
machine when a module pulls from a live vendor system. The module still owns
its scheduler, tables, credentials, and vendor-specific fetch adapter.

```python
from civiccore.connectors import (
    SyncCircuitState,
    SyncRunResult,
    apply_sync_run_result,
    build_sync_operator_status,
    build_sync_source_status,
)

state = SyncCircuitState(connector="granicus", source_name="Granicus production")
state = apply_sync_run_result(
    state,
    SyncRunResult(records_discovered=4, records_succeeded=3, records_failed=1),
)
status = build_sync_operator_status(state)
print(status.public_dict()["message"])
source_status = build_sync_source_status(state, sync_schedule="0 2 * * *")
print(source_status.public_dict()["next_sync_at"])
```

Default behavior matches the CivicRecords AI pattern: healthy after successful
runs, degraded while failures remain, and circuit-open after five consecutive
full-run failures. Grace-period sources open after two full-run failures so
operators see the problem before scheduled pulls keep compounding it.
Use `build_sync_source_status()` for list/card views that need the same health
decision plus active failure counts, pause state, last status, actionable fix
copy, and next scheduled run.

### Run Migrations from a Consumer

CivicCore migrations run before a downstream module's migrations. Consumer
modules use CivicCore's migration runner and keep their own version table so
revision names do not collide.

The release gate verifies the CivicCore migration chain, including
`civiccore_0001_baseline_v1` and `civiccore_0002_llm`.

## 3. Architecture Reference

### Shipped vs Planned

![CivicCore extraction map](docs/diagrams/civiccore-extraction-map.svg)

Shipped implementation in the current development line:

```text
civiccore/
  audit/        hash-chained audit primitives and persisted audit-log helpers
  city_profile/ local city/deployment configuration models
  connectors/   offline manifests, local-first import helpers, live-sync primitives
  db/           shared SQLAlchemy declarative Base
  exports/      static export-bundle helpers
  ingest/       shared contracts, cited-source validation, document ingestion,
                sentence-aware chunking, and pgvector embedding storage
  llm/          providers, templates, registry, context, structured output
  migrations/   migration runner and shared schema baseline
  notifications/ notice deadline + compliance helpers
  onboarding/   shared onboarding profile field-order/progress helpers
  scheduling/   cron validation and next-run helpers
  provenance/   source/citation/provenance metadata contracts
```

Still planned namespaces:

```text
civiccore/
  catalog/       future catalog primitives
  exemptions/    future 50-state public-records exemption engine
  notifications/ delivery queues and outbound orchestration remain future work
  onboarding/    future web onboarding UI/persistence flows
  scheduling/    scheduler runtime and task queue remain module-owned
  scaffold/      future scaffolding helpers
  verification/  future sovereignty verification
```

### Migration Order

![Migration order](docs/diagrams/migration-order.svg)

Consumer applications run CivicCore migrations first, then their own module
migrations. Separate Alembic version tables prevent revision-name collisions.

### LLM Provider Abstraction

![Provider abstraction](docs/diagrams/provider-abstraction.svg)

The provider abstraction keeps local Ollama as the sovereignty-first default
while allowing explicitly configured cloud providers where a city authorizes
them.

### Compatibility

Current v0.1.0 module foundations still pin older civiccore lines.
Production-depth consumers should move only to the released CivicCore version
recorded in their compatibility matrix.
