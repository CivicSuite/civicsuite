# CivicCore Cleanroom Harness

Status: CO-6 harness, added for outside-auditor reproduction.

The cleanroom harness proves the CivicCore release gate and the public
install-and-verify path from a pinned container with no inherited maintainer
state. It provisions CivicCore from an explicit commit SHA, runs the release
gate, verifies the release-provenance fixtures, verifies the live `v0.22.1`
Sigstore attestation, verifies the `SHA256SUMS.txt` release-asset path, and
then runs an offline smoke with Docker networking disabled.

## Run

From a fresh clone:

```bash
bash scripts/run-civiccore-cleanroom.sh <commit-sha>
```

The host must have Docker and a usable Python interpreter on `PATH`. The
orchestrator probes `python`, `python3`, `python.exe`, and `py -3` by executing
a short Python import before it uses an interpreter for the final manifest
comparison.

The script defaults to two runs so auditors can compare stable manifests:

```bash
CLEANROOM_RUN_COUNT=2 bash scripts/run-civiccore-cleanroom.sh <commit-sha>
```

Evidence is written to:

```text
docs/evidence/co6-civiccore-cleanroom-<commit-prefix>/
```

## Pinned Inputs

- Base image: `python:3.13-slim-bookworm@sha256:bb73517d48bd32016e15eade0c009b2724ec3a025a9975b5cd9b251d0dcadb33`
- Cosign: `v3.0.6`
- Cosign Linux amd64 SHA256:
  `c956e5dfcac53d52bcf058360d579472f0c1d2d9b69f55209e256fe7783f4c74`
- Baseline release under test: `v0.22.1`

## Evidence

Each run directory contains:

- `cleanroom-manifest.json` - stable manifest used for cross-machine
  comparison.
- `cleanroom-manifest.sha256` - SHA256 for the stable manifest.
- `cleanroom-manifest.json.sig` and `evidence-signing-public.pem` - per-run
  OpenSSL signature and verification key for the stable manifest.
- `files.sha256` - hashes for evidence files in the run directory.
- `cleanroom-evidence.tar.gz` and `.sha256` - compressed evidence bundle and
  checksum.
- `logs/` - command logs for each verification path.
- `release-assets/` - downloaded `v0.22.1` release assets used by the live
  verification paths.

`run-metadata.json`, signatures, and compressed bundles are run-specific. The
cross-machine comparison surface is `cleanroom-manifest.json`; two independent
runs pass when those stable manifest hashes match.

## Network Boundary

Network is allowed only for provisioning and verification endpoints:

- `https://github.com/CivicSuite/civiccore.git`
- `https://github.com/CivicSuite/civiccore/releases/download/v0.22.1/*`
- `https://api.github.com/repos/CivicSuite/civiccore/*`
- `https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/v3.0.6/cosign-linux-amd64`
- `https://pypi.org/*`
- `https://files.pythonhosted.org/*`
- Sigstore transparency and certificate endpoints used by
  `cosign verify-blob`

After provisioning, the orchestrator runs the offline smoke and offline fixture
verification through `docker run --network none`. Failure of that phase is a
cleanroom failure.
