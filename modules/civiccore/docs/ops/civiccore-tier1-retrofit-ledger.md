# CivicCore Tier 1 Retrofit Ledger

Status: CO-3 ledger, live-release scan current as of 2026-05-05.

This ledger covers every public CivicCore GitHub Release visible during the
CO-3 live scan. It does not rewrite history and does not alter any pre-baseline
release notes, tags, or assets. The correction action taken here is a
repo-controlled ledger plus documentation truth update.

## Rules

- `v0.22.1` is the first CivicCore Sigstore-attested baseline release.
- `v0.22.0` and earlier releases are retained for historical installs, but are
  not provenance baselines.
- A pre-baseline release may become attested only through a future additive
  attestation operation with explicit per-release or explicit batch
  authorization.
- Downstream modules requiring procurement-grade provenance should pin to
  `v0.22.1` or a later Sigstore-attested release when their compatibility
  matrix permits it.

Structured source of truth:
[`docs/ops/civiccore-tier1-retrofit-ledger.json`](civiccore-tier1-retrofit-ledger.json).

Verification:

```bash
python scripts/check-tier1-ledger.py
python scripts/check-tier1-ledger.py --live
```

The live check requires every historical/pre-baseline release in this ledger to
remain visible. Newer post-baseline releases do not need retroactive CO-3 rows,
but the live check permits them only when the GitHub release exposes both
`release-attestation.json` and `release-attestation.json.bundle`.

## Auditor Interpretation

Zero CO-3 historical CivicCore release tags are intentionally left unledgered.
The pre-baseline entries are explicit no-attestation decisions, not implied
backfills. Later post-baseline releases are governed by their own release
attestation and closeout evidence. If a future sprint publishes additive attestations for any
pre-baseline release, that release must be moved out of
`pre_gate_no_attestation_do_not_promote` in the JSON ledger and verified with
`python scripts/check-tier1-ledger.py --live`.
