"""Make city_profile.state nullable to allow in-progress onboarding state.

T5A (Tier 5 Blocker A): the onboarding interview must be able to create a
CityProfile row with just the first answer (city_name). Previously the
`state` column was NOT NULL, blocking any partial-state row. Making it
nullable is the truthful modeling of a row whose `onboarding_status` is
`in_progress` — the operator hasn't answered every question yet, and the
DB should reflect that rather than demand a placeholder value.

`city_name` stays NOT NULL because the onboarding walk always asks
`city_name` first and only creates the row after that answer arrives.
